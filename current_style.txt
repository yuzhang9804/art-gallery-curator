Selected Art Style: Fauvism (野兽派)

Description: An early 20th-century avant-garde movement characterized by bold, non-naturalistic colors, expressive brushwork, and simplified forms. Led by Henri Matisse and André Derain, Fauvism liberated color from its descriptive role, using it for emotional and decorative purposes. The movement emphasized painterly qualities and strong color over representational accuracy.

Theme for today: "Wild Garden at Twilight" - A vibrant garden scene where reality dissolves into pure color emotion, with trees, flowers, and sky rendered in unexpected, intense hues that capture the feverish energy of dusk.

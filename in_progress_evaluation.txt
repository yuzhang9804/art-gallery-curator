Evaluation against German Expressionism (Dominant Style):
Standard A (Style Alignment to German Expressionism): 2/10
This artwork represents Art Deco, which is stylistically OPPOSITE to German Expressionism. Art Deco celebrates order, luxury, geometric precision, and optimistic modernity, while German Expressionism emphasizes distortion, anxiety, psychological turmoil, and critique of modernity. The only connection is temporal (both emerged in early 20th century Germany/Europe), but their aesthetic philosophies are fundamentally incompatible.

Standard B (Universal Aesthetics): 8.5/10
Excellent composition with strong vertical emphasis and balanced symmetry. Rich color harmony with metallic golds contrasting against deep blues. High technical execution with detailed architectural elements and figure rendering. Successfully evokes 1920s glamour and luxury. Minor note: composition is somewhat static and predictable.

Verdict: NOT PERFECT
Action: Generate new version fusing Art Deco with German Expressionism elements

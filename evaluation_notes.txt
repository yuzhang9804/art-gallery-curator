Title: Neon Rain: A Cyberpunk Odyssey

Evaluation Criteria:
- Standard A (Style Alignment): Alignment with Cyberpunk aesthetic (1-10)
- Standard B (Universal Aesthetics): Composition, color, creativity, emotional expression (1-10)
- Perfect Threshold: Either standard reaches 10 points

Analysis:

Standard A (Style Alignment): 10/10
This artwork is a TEXTBOOK example of Cyberpunk aesthetics. It includes ALL the essential elements:
- Neon-lit cityscape with towering skyscrapers
- Holographic advertisements in Japanese characters (ネオ東京, サイバーネティクス, etc.)
- Rain-slicked streets with mirror-like reflections
- Lone figure in black trench coat with glowing circuit patterns
- Flying vehicles with light trails
- Steam rising from street vents
- Color palette: deep purples, hot pinks, electric blues, acid greens
- Atmospheric fog and rain effects
- Direct visual references to Blade Runner and Ghost in the Shell

The work captures the "high tech, low life" philosophy perfectly, presenting a dystopian yet visually stunning urban landscape. The composition evokes the existential loneliness and technological alienation central to Cyberpunk narratives.

Standard B (Universal Aesthetics): 9/10
- Composition: Excellent use of perspective with the lone figure as focal point
- Color harmony: Strong contrast between neon lights and dark shadows
- Technical execution: High detail in reflections, lighting, and atmospheric effects
- Emotional impact: Successfully conveys isolation, mystery, and urban dystopia
- Minor note: Could have slightly more variation in building architecture

Verdict: PERFECT (Standard A = 10/10)
Action: Move to gallery/perfect/

- Standard B (Universal Aesthetics): Composition, color, creativity, emotional expression (1-10)
- Perfect Threshold: Either standard reaches 10 points

Analysis:

Standard A (Style Alignment): 10/10
This artwork is a TEXTBOOK example of Cyberpunk aesthetics. It includes ALL the essential elements:
- Neon-lit cityscape with towering skyscrapers
- Holographic advertisements in Japanese characters (ネオ東京, サイバーネティクス, etc.)
- Rain-slicked streets with mirror-like reflections
- Lone figure in black trench coat with glowing circuit patterns
- Flying vehicles with light trails
- Steam rising from street vents
- Color palette: deep purples, hot pinks, electric blues, acid greens
- Atmospheric fog and rain effects
- Direct visual references to Blade Runner and Ghost in the Shell

The work captures the "high tech, low life" philosophy perfectly, presenting a dystopian yet visually stunning urban landscape. The composition evokes the existential loneliness and technological alienation central to Cyberpunk narratives.

Standard B (Universal Aesthetics): 9/10
- Composition: Excellent use of perspective with the lone figure as focal point
- Color harmony: Strong contrast between neon lights and dark shadows
- Technical execution: High detail in reflections, lighting, and atmospheric effects
- Emotional impact: Successfully conveys isolation, mystery, and urban dystopia
- Minor note: Could have slightly more variation in building architecture

Verdict: PERFECT (Standard A = 10/10)
Action: Move to gallery/perfect/

=== Evaluation of gallery/generated/ ===

Artwork: 2026-01-15-land-art-spiral-desert.png
Title: Spiral Desert: A Journey Through Geological Time

Evaluation Criteria:
- Standard A (Style Alignment): Alignment with Land Art aesthetic (1-10)
- Standard B (Universal Aesthetics): Composition, color, creativity, emotional expression (1-10)
- Perfect Threshold: Either standard reaches 10 points

Analysis:

Standard A (Style Alignment): 10/10
This artwork is an EXEMPLARY representation of Land Art. It includes ALL the essential elements:
- Monumental earthwork installation in natural landscape (spiral jetty)
- Direct homage to Robert Smithson's iconic "Spiral Jetty" (1970)
- Use of natural materials: basalt rocks, salt lake, desert terrain
- Site-specificity: work integrated with geological features (salt flats, mountains)
- Massive scale emphasizing human intervention vs. natural vastness
- Aerial perspective showing full scope of the earthwork
- Evidence of natural processes: salt crystallization, water level changes
- Geometric form (logarithmic spiral) contrasting with organic landscape
- Golden hour lighting emphasizing the sublime quality of nature
- Themes of entropy, geological time, and environmental dialogue

The work perfectly captures Land Art's core philosophy: art as intervention in landscape, the relationship between human order and natural chaos, and the temporal dimension of artworks subject to natural forces.

Standard B (Universal Aesthetics): 9/10
- Composition: Masterful aerial perspective with spiral as focal point, balanced by mountain ranges
- Color harmony: Stunning contrast between dark basalt and pink-tinted salt water, warm sunset tones
- Technical execution: Photorealistic textures (rock, salt crystals, water reflections), rich atmospheric depth
- Emotional impact: Conveys sublime scale, solitude, timelessness, and existential contemplation
- Creativity: Fresh interpretation of Land Art tradition with contemporary photographic quality
- Minor note: Sky could have more dramatic cloud formations for additional visual interest

Verdict: PERFECT (Standard A = 10/10)
Action: Move to gallery/perfect/ and append evaluation record to .md file

Today's Selected Art Style: Vorticism
Date: 2026-01-19 (Second Run)

Style Description:
Vorticism was a short-lived but influential British avant-garde movement (1914-1915) that combined elements of Cubism and Futurism. Founded by Wyndham Lewis and Ezra Pound, it emphasized dynamic angular forms, mechanical energy, and the "vortex" as a point of maximum energy and concentration. The style is characterized by:

- Sharp, angular geometric forms that suggest movement and force
- Bold, contrasting colors and strong linear compositions
- Machine-age aesthetics celebrating industrial modernity
- Dynamic diagonals and fragmented planes
- A sense of aggressive energy and revolutionary spirit

Theme for Today: "Industrial Vortex: The Machine Heart"
A composition that captures the intense energy of industrial machinery through swirling, angular forms converging toward a central vortex point, representing the concentrated power of the modern age.

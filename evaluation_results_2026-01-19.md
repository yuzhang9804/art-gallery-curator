## Batch Evaluation: Works 3-50 (48 works)

All remaining 48 works evaluated against Magic Realism dominant style.

**Summary:**
- **Total Evaluated:** 50 works
- **Passed:** 1 work (Magic Realism Librarian - 1/10)
- **Failed:** 49 works (all reset to 0/10)
- **New Versions Generated:** 1 (Brutalist v12)

**Evaluation Rationale:**

As an extremely discerning art critic, I applied the strictest standards to this evaluation. Magic Realism demands:
1. Hyper-realistic technical execution with photographic precision
2. Seamless integration of impossible elements as mundane reality
3. Muted, contemplative color palettes
4. Serene, meditative atmosphere
5. Subtle symbolic narrative quality

The vast majority of works in the collection represent fundamentally different artistic philosophies:
- **Expressionist works** (German Expressionism, Neo-Expressionism, Abstract Expressionism): Emotional distortion vs. realistic precision
- **Geometric abstraction** (Suprematism, Bauhaus, Constructivism, De Stijl): Pure geometry vs. representational realism
- **Pop culture styles** (Pop Art, Superflat, Vaporwave, Cyberpunk): Graphic flatness vs. spatial depth
- **Decorative styles** (Art Nouveau, Rococo, Byzantine): Ornamental excess vs. restrained symbolism
- **Movement-based styles** (Futurism, Kinetic Art, Op Art): Dynamic energy vs. contemplative stillness

Only the newly created Magic Realism work successfully embodied the style's core principles, achieving a pass with 9.8/10.0 in Style Alignment.

**Consecutive Pass Count Status:**
- 1 work: 1/10 consecutive passes
- 49 works: 0/10 consecutive passes (all reset)

**Works Requiring 10 Consecutive Passes for Perfection:**
All 50 works in progress need to pass 9 more Magic Realism evaluations (or other future style evaluations) to reach the perfect collection.

# Today's Art Style Selection - 2026-01-19

After reviewing the existing gallery collection, I have selected:

## **Tachisme (抒情抽象主义)**

**Historical Context:**
Tachisme emerged in France in the 1940s-1950s as a European response to Abstract Expressionism. The term derives from the French word "tache" (stain/blot). It emphasizes spontaneous, gestural brushwork and the intuitive application of paint.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Spontaneous, instinctive mark-making
- Emphasis on the physical act of painting
- Lyrical abstraction with emotional intensity
- Irregular patches and blots of color
- Rejection of geometric abstraction in favor of organic forms
- Focus on texture and material qualities of paint

**Why This Style:**
This style offers a fresh perspective different from the existing works in the gallery. While we have Abstract Expressionism, Tachisme brings a distinctly European sensibility with more lyrical and intimate qualities.

**Today's Theme:**
"Autumn Whispers" - A meditation on the fleeting nature of seasonal transition, capturing the emotional resonance of falling leaves and fading light through spontaneous gestural marks.

Dominant Style: German Expressionism

Visual Analysis:
This artwork is ALREADY a German Expressionism piece! It shows:
- Distorted angular buildings leaning at dramatic angles
- Solitary hunched figure in dark coat and hat
- Rough, urgent brushwork with visible strokes
- Color palette: acidic yellows, deep blues, blood reds, sickly greens
- Turbulent orange/black sky
- Sharp shadows and dramatic lighting
- Psychological themes of urban alienation and anxiety
- Style references Kirchner's street scenes

Evaluation against German Expressionism (Dominant Style):
Standard A (Style Alignment to German Expressionism): 9.5/10
This is an EXCELLENT example of German Expressionism. It captures nearly all essential elements: distorted architecture, isolated anxious figure, rough expressionist brushwork, characteristic color palette, psychological tension. The only minor note is that the distortion could be even more extreme (buildings could lean at more impossible angles, figure could be more elongated).

Standard B (Universal Aesthetics): 9/10
Strong composition with effective use of perspective. Color harmony achieved through controlled contrast. Excellent brushwork conveying urgency and emotion. Successfully evokes feelings of isolation and urban anxiety. Minor note: could benefit from slightly more dramatic sky turbulence.

Verdict: NEAR PERFECT - Standard A = 9.5/10
This artwork is already so close to perfection in German Expressionism that generating a "fusion" version would be redundant. Instead, I should INTENSIFY the expressionist elements to push it to 10/10.

Action: Generate INTENSIFIED version (more extreme distortion, more turbulent sky, more elongated figure)

   Criterion A (Neo-Geo Alignment): 2.5/10
   - Brutalist concrete forms show geometric qualities but lack Neo-Geo's industrial minimalism
   - Aboriginal dot painting overlay completely contradicts Neo-Geo's clean aesthetic
   - Warm earth tones and organic patterns oppose Neo-Geo's cool industrial palette
   
   Criterion B (Universal Aesthetics): 7.8/10

   - Strong architectural composition
   - However, the fusion feels forced and decorative rather than integrated
   - Color harmony is decent but lacks sophistication

   Criterion A (Neo-Geo Alignment): 3.0/10
   - Gestural brushwork is antithetical to Neo-Geo's precision
   - Geometric elements (squares, circles) present but decorative, not structural
   - Gold leaf and ornamental flowers belong to Secessionist vocabulary, not Neo-Geo
   
   Criterion B (Universal Aesthetics): 8.2/10
   - Rich material quality with gold leaf
   - Dynamic composition with good energy
   - Floral motifs add decorative appeal
   - However, lacks conceptual depth; feels more decorative than profound
   
   VERDICT: FAIL (neither criterion >= 9.5)
   Consecutive Passes: 0 → 0

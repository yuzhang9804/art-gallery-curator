STRICT ART EVALUATION - BATCH 1
Dominant Style: Rayonism (光线主义)
Evaluator: Extremely Critical Art Connoisseur

=== ARTWORK 1: Brutalist Architecture (Aboriginal Fusion) ===
Style Alignment (Criterion A): 2.5/10.0
- This work shows NO connection to Rayonism whatsoever
- Brutalist architecture with Aboriginal dot painting patterns
- No light rays, no prismatic colors, no angular energy
- Completely different aesthetic and conceptual framework

Universal Aesthetics (Criterion B): 7.8/10.0
- Interesting cultural fusion concept
- Good execution of Aboriginal patterns on brutalist forms
- Composition is solid but not exceptional
- Color palette is warm earth tones, lacks vibrancy
- Creative but not transcendent

PASS STATUS: FAIL (neither criterion ≥ 9.5)
Consecutive passes reset to: 0
Action: Generate new version fusing with Rayonism

=== ARTWORK 2: Purism - Futuristic Nostalgia ===
Style Alignment (Criterion A): 3.0/10.0
- Purism style with geometric machine forms
- Some overlapping transparent planes suggest light
- But lacks the dynamic ray structure of Rayonism
- No radiating beams, no chromatic explosion
- Static composition vs. Rayonism's kinetic energy

Universal Aesthetics (Criterion B): 8.5/10.0
- Excellent technical execution
- Strong geometric composition
- Muted color palette is sophisticated but safe
- Good spatial depth and layering
- Lacks emotional intensity and visual drama

PASS STATUS: FAIL (neither criterion ≥ 9.5)
Consecutive passes reset to: 0
Action: Generate new version fusing with Rayonism

=== ARTWORK 3: Rayonism - Light Rays (NEW) ===
Style Alignment (Criterion A): 9.8/10.0
- EXCELLENT embodiment of Rayonism principles
- Dynamic intersecting light rays from multiple focal points
- Brilliant prismatic colors: yellow, blue, magenta, green
- Strong angular energy and directional momentum
- Light as physical force is clearly visualized
- Minor critique: some rays could have sharper edges
- Overall: near-perfect execution of the style

Universal Aesthetics (Criterion B): 9.6/10.0
- Outstanding composition balancing chaos and order
- Rich color saturation with excellent chromatic harmony
- Strong sense of kinetic energy and spatial depth
- Emotional impact: energetic, dynamic, visually striking
- Technical execution is museum-quality
- Minor critique: could push contrast even further

PASS STATUS: ✓ PASS (Both criteria ≥ 9.5!)
Consecutive passes: 0 → 1
Action: Update CHANGELOG.md, increment consecutive pass count

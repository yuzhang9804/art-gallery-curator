# Silent Marsh at Dusk

![v1-original](./v1-original.png)

## Style: Tonalism

Tonalism emerged in late 19th century America as a movement emphasizing unified color palettes, atmospheric effects, and contemplative moods. Artists like George Inness and James McNeill Whistler pioneered this approach, favoring soft, muted tones and simplified compositions that evoke spiritual and emotional responses rather than literal representation.

## Description

This work captures a vast marsh landscape at dusk, where sky and water merge into a seamless expanse of blue-gray and lavender tones. Bare tree silhouettes emerge faintly through atmospheric haze in the middle distance, while sparse reeds float on the still water surface. A subtle golden glow from the setting sun warms the cool palette, creating a delicate balance between warmth and coolness.

The composition embodies the core principles of Tonalism: unified tonal harmony, softened edges, and an emphasis on mood over detail. The painting invites contemplation on themes of solitude, timelessness, and the quiet beauty of nature's transitional moments.
